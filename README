Ruby OpenACN 

ACN is the Architecture for Control Networks, a set of protocols and languages for
the control of entertainment technology.

This package will consist of Ruby language bindings for the OpenACN library as well as Ruby only 
classes for using the ACN Device Description Language (DDL)

See www.openacn.org for the openACN C library and details of the ACN protocols.

ACN consists of:
  Root Layer Protocol (RLP)
    A description of PDU and packet formats and basic operation of higher level protocols.

  Device Description Language (DDL)
    An XML schema describing devices which communicate via the ACN suite.
    
  Device Management Protocol (DMP)
    The protocol with which devices send and receive commands. 
    
  Session Data Transport (SDT)
    A reliable transport layer protocol on top of UDP with support for multicasting.
    Designed to sit under DMP or other protocols.

  Discovery:
    Using SLP to discover what devices are on our network. 
    
Current status: 
        Work on DDL library has been started.
        DMP bindings not started.
        RLP not started.
        SDT not started.
